An element wraps the `polymerGesture` functionality and give you access to the events as attributes and extendables function on an element

##### Example

		<x-gesture-handle on-tap="tapHandler">
			<some-element>...</some-element>
		</x-gesture-handle>

the exposed list of gesture events are:

		var polymerGesturesList = [
			// a pointer is activated, or a device button held.
			'down',		
			// a pointer is deactivated, or a device button released. 
			// Same target as down, provides the element under the 
			// pointer with the relatedTarget property	
			'up',			
			// denotes the beginning of a series of tracking events. 
			// Same target as down.
			'trackstart',	
			// fires for all pointer movement being tracked.
			'track',		
			// denotes the end of a series of tracking events. 
			// Same target as down. Provides the element under 
			// the pointer with the relatedTarget property.
			'trackend',		
			// a pointer has quickly gone down and up. Used to denote activation.
			'tap',
			// a pointer is held down for 200ms.			
			'hold',
			// fired every 200ms while a pointer is held down.			
			'holdpulse',
			// a pointer is released or moved.	
			'release'		
		];

The events are available using the `on` prefix like `on-tap='tapHandler'`

If you are extending the element you can use the same syntax with in the polymer constructor.

		'on-tap': function(e){ ... }

Make sure to call `this.super()` in the `ready` callback if you are extending the element.

@element x-gesture-handle
@blurb An element that automaticly sizes itself baced on the parent containers width and the supplied aspect ratio.
